<font face="impact"><p><h3><u>Personal Websites</u></h3></p></font>

<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.sugarbunnyshop.com">Sugar Bunny Shop</a></li>
	<font size="2">
	<p></p><i>The layout of this shop is compact and while it is a little busy, it has a lot of good features. One of the features I liked the most is the self-rotating image that directs you to the different highlighted items. The overall patchwork of site is also quirky and visually appealing.</i>
	</font>
	
	<li><a href="http://www.omocat-shop.com">OMOCAT</a></li>
	<font size="2">
	<p></p><i>Absolutely love the minimalist design to the site. It's simple, clean, and is easy to navigate. The rotating image is, again, something I really like. I also like the use of dropdown menus for navigation purposes, as it is cleaner than scattered or listed links. The way the images change when you hover over them is also neat, to see more of the item. Also the check-out system is very simple.</i>
	</font>
	
	<li><a href="http://thunderpaw.co">Thunderpaw</a></li>
	<font size="2">
	<p></p><i>While this is not a shop, I really like the layout of the website. It's, agian, simple even for a webcomic. I really like the layering of images and text throughout the website. For example, there are .gifs and moving images alongside stillimages and moving images over other moving images, creating depth to the page. </i>
	</font>

	<li><a href="http://www.heychickadee.com">Hey Chickadee</a></li>
	<font size="2">
	<p></p><i>This shop is very simple in its layout. There is a banner, dropdown menus, and a rotating image. There is a theme within these shops, I think you can tell. I also really like the search function for the website which would be neat to learn how to do. The bottom bar is also very well organized.</i>
	</font>
	
	<li><a href="http://www.barachan.com">Barachan</a></li>
	<font size="2">
	<p></p><i>The layout of this site is very well done because it is clean, centered, and aligned to perfection. I love the sample-like nature of the homepage that links to a in-window pop-up. I really like this because you are not forced to leave the page you are on in order to view just an image.I also like how the introduction is done further down as it is alighted next to an image while keeping within a nice form.</i>
